# DailyProgrammer386
 A Python solution for Daily Programmer challenge 386 (for reference)

## Purpose
 The purpose for this repository is to provide a reference for a potential
 solution for Daily Programmer's challenge #386. However, please note that
 this solution is quite brute forced and pretty inelegant. There's some
 memoization via storing known solutions in cache, but that's pretty much it
 and, without this cache, this code runs very slowly.
 
 That being said, this should satisfy the solution for #386. Albeit, quite
 naively.
 
## Usage
 py|python 386.py
 
## Future Work
 If future work is to be done focus should rest on optimizing the solution,
 there needs to be reasearch on how to simplify the recursion or find a way to
 get to the answer through a completely different algorithm.
